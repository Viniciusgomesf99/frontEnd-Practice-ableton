            <h3>Making music isn't easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But<br>
            when you're in the flow, it's incredibly rewarding.</h3>

            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our<br>
            passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <h3>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries<br>
            divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los<br>
            Angeles and Tokyo.</h3>

            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day.<br>
            We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some<br>
            are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that<br>
            each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of<br>
            music culture.</p>

            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their<br>
            magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are<br>
            richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always<br>
            agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

            and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>

            <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new <br>
            knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized<br>
            development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and<br>

            <p>If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with<br>
            free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive<br>
            health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office<br>
            hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the<br>
            year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
