        <section class="about">
            <h1>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries
            divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los
            Angeles and Tokyo.</h1>

            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day.
            We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some
            are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that
            each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of
            music culture.</p>

            We only work on a few products and we strive to make them
            great.</h1>

            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their
            magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
            richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always
            agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

            <h1>We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally

            <p id="p1">We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally
            and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>

            <p id="p2">Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new 
            knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
            development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and

            <p>If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with

            hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the
